# mern-app
Recently learnt react, thought I would make a MERN stack app

## Setting Up
You will need the following
    - node js v14 or higher
    - A mongo database

1. Clone the repository
2. Change directories to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies do the same for the `api` folder
3. Change the connection URL in the `index.js` file inside of `api/src`
4. Make sure you're inside of the `frontend` directory and run `yarn start`, this will start the react app which will then be available at `http://localhost:3000`
5. Go inside of the `api` directory and run `node src/index`, this will start the API
6. You may now navigate to the react app and enjoy!
